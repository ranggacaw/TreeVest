# EPIC-012: Build Information & Education Center

> **Status:** DRAFT (PRD-based, pending FSD/TDD-Lite refinement)

## Business Value Statement
Educate potential and existing investors about fruit tree investing, reduce barriers to entry, and build informed decision-making capability. An education center increases investor confidence, reduces support burden, and improves investment quality by helping users understand risks and opportunities.

## Description
This EPIC builds the Information & Education Center, a content-rich section of the platform that includes investment education materials (how fruit tree investing works, risk factors, harvest cycle explanations, market trends), and a farm/crop encyclopedia (detailed information about each fruit type, growing conditions, market demand, seasonality charts). This is primarily a content management and display system.

## Dependencies
- **Prerequisite EPICs:** None (can be built independently)
- **External Dependencies:** Content authoring (business/agronomic team)
- **Technical Prerequisites:**
  - Simple Eloquent-based CMS (Article, Category, Tag models with MySQL storage)
  - Inertia::render() pages for content display (public) and admin content management
  - Laravel filesystem for media/image storage
  - Full-text search via MySQL FULLTEXT indexes or Laravel Scout

## Complexity Assessment
- **Size:** S
- **Technical Complexity:** Low (content display, basic CMS)
- **Integration Complexity:** Low (standalone content system)
- **Estimated Story Count:** 5-8

## Risks & Assumptions
**Assumptions:**
- Content is authored by the business team, not generated by the system
- A simple CMS or structured content model is sufficient (no full-featured CMS needed)
- CMS built as simple Eloquent models (Article, Category, Tag) — no third-party CMS package needed
- Content pages rendered as Inertia/React page components with Tailwind CSS styling
- Education content is publicly accessible (no authentication required to view)
- Public content pages accessible without authentication via Laravel route middleware
- Seasonality charts are static or semi-static (updated periodically, not real-time)
- Seasonality charts rendered client-side using a React charting library
- Content search uses MySQL FULLTEXT indexes (upgradeable to Laravel Scout + Meilisearch later)

**Risks:**
- Content quality and availability depends on business team effort
- Stale content (outdated market trends) could mislead investors
- Risk factor disclosures must be reviewed by legal team
- Content must be neutral and not constitute financial advice
