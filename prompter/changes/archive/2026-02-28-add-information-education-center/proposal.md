# Change: Add Information & Education Center

> **EPIC:** EPIC-012: Build Information & Education Center
> **Created:** 2026-02-28
> **Status:** Proposal

## Why

The platform needs to educate potential and existing investors about fruit tree investing to reduce barriers to entry and build informed decision-making capability. An education center increases investor confidence, reduces support burden, and improves investment quality by helping users understand risks and opportunities.

Currently, the platform has no:
- Educational content about how fruit tree investing works
- Risk factor explanations and mitigation strategies
- Harvest cycle and market trend information
- Encyclopedia of fruit types and growing conditions

Without this information, investors may:
- Make poorly informed investment decisions
- Misunderstand risks and harvest cycles
- Generate excessive support requests
- Have low confidence in the platform

## Impact

### Affected Specs
- **NEW CAPABILITY**: `content-management` (CMS for articles, categories, tags)

### Affected Code
- `database/migrations/` - Add tables for articles, categories, tags, article_category, article_tag
- `app/Models/Article.php` - Article Eloquent model
- `app/Models/Category.php` - Category Eloquent model
- `app/Models/Tag.php` - Tag Eloquent model
- `app/Http/Controllers/ArticleController.php` - Public article viewing
- `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/ArticleController.php` - Admin article management
- `routes/web.php` - Public and admin routes for content
- `resources/js/Pages/Education/` - Public education pages (React/Inertia)
- `resources/js/Pages/Encyclopedia/` - Public encyclopedia pages (React/Inertia)
- `resources/js/Pages/Admin/Articles/` - Admin CMS pages (React/Inertia)
- `resources/js/Components/RichTextEditor.tsx` - Rich text editor component
- `resources/js/Components/SeasonalityChart.tsx` - Seasonality chart component
- `tests/Feature/` - Content viewing and management tests

### Breaking Changes
- None (new feature, no existing functionality changed)

### Dependency Impact
- **Independent**: Can be implemented without other EPICs
- **Complements**: EPIC-005 (Crop Catalog - encyclopedia provides educational context for crops)
- **Used By**: All users (investors, farm owners, admins) and public visitors

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risks
1. **Content quality and availability**: Depends on business team to author content
   - *Mitigation*: Provide content templates and guidelines; seed initial content
   
2. **Stale content**: Outdated market trends could mislead investors
   - *Mitigation*: Add "Last Updated" timestamps; admin dashboard shows stale content alerts
   
3. **Legal compliance**: Risk disclosures must be legally reviewed
   - *Mitigation*: Include review workflow; legal disclaimer on all educational content
   
4. **Performance**: Full-text search on large content corpus
   - *Mitigation*: Start with MySQL FULLTEXT indexes; plan migration to Laravel Scout if needed

5. **Content constitutes financial advice**: Educational content must remain neutral
   - *Mitigation*: Clear disclaimers; legal review process; "for educational purposes only" notices

### Assumptions
- Content is authored by business team, not generated by the system
- Simple Eloquent-based CMS is sufficient (no third-party CMS package needed)
- Education content is publicly accessible (no authentication required to view)
- Seasonality charts are semi-static (updated periodically, not real-time)
- Content search uses MySQL FULLTEXT indexes (upgradeable to Laravel Scout + Meilisearch later)
- Articles use Markdown or HTML for rich content formatting

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Admin can create, edit, and publish articles via web interface
- [ ] Articles are organized by categories and tags
- [ ] Public users can browse and search all published content
- [ ] Education section includes at least 5 core articles (investig basics, risks, harvest cycles, ROI, market trends)
- [ ] Encyclopedia includes detailed pages for at least 6 major fruit types (Durian, Mango, Grapes, Melon, Citrus, Others)
- [ ] Each fruit type page includes growing conditions, market demand, and seasonality chart
- [ ] Full-text search returns relevant results in < 500ms
- [ ] Content pages load in < 1 second
- [ ] Rich text editor supports images, headings, lists, and formatting
- [ ] All content passes accessibility checks (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design works on all screen sizes

## Implementation Notes

### Database Schema
```
articles
- id
- title
- slug (unique)
- content (text/markdown)
- excerpt
- featured_image
- status (draft/published)
- published_at
- author_id (foreign key to users)
- view_count
- created_at, updated_at

categories
- id
- name
- slug (unique)
- description
- created_at, updated_at

tags
- id
- name
- slug (unique)
- created_at, updated_at

article_category (pivot)
- article_id
- category_id

article_tag (pivot)
- article_id
- tag_id
```

### Content Structure
**Education Section Categories:**
- Getting Started
- Risk Management
- Harvest Cycles
- Market Analysis
- Investment Strategies

**Encyclopedia Categories:**
- Durian
- Mango
- Grapes
- Melon
- Citrus
- Others (Avocado, Longan, Rambutan, Mangosteen)

### Rich Text Editor
Use a React-based editor library:
- TipTap (recommended - headless, extensible)
- Or Quill.js (simpler, good default features)
- Or Draft.js (Facebook's editor framework)

### Seasonality Chart
Use a React charting library:
- Recharts (recommended - React-native charts, composable)
- Or Chart.js with react-chartjs-2
- Or Victory (declarative React charts)

### Public Access Pattern
```php
// routes/web.php
Route::prefix('education')->name('education.')->group(function () {
    Route::get('/', [ArticleController::class, 'index'])->name('index');
    Route::get('/{article:slug}', [ArticleController::class, 'show'])->name('show');
});

Route::prefix('encyclopedia')->name('encyclopedia.')->group(function () {
    Route::get('/', [EncyclopediaController::class, 'index'])->name('index');
    Route::get('/{fruitType:slug}', [EncyclopediaController::class, 'show'])->name('show');
});
```

### Admin CMS Routes
```php
Route::middleware(['auth', 'role:admin'])->prefix('admin')->group(function () {
    Route::resource('articles', Admin\ArticleController::class);
    Route::post('articles/{article}/publish', [Admin\ArticleController::class, 'publish'])->name('admin.articles.publish');
    Route::post('articles/{article}/unpublish', [Admin\ArticleController::class, 'unpublish'])->name('admin.articles.unpublish');
});
```

### Content Seeding
Create seeders for initial content:
- `EducationContentSeeder` - Seeds 5 core education articles
- `EncyclopediaSeeder` - Seeds 6 major fruit type encyclopedia entries
- `CategorySeeder` - Seeds all categories
- `TagSeeder` - Seeds common tags
